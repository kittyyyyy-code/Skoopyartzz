      || Ren Morikawa stood in front of the school gates, sweat dripping down his back as he stared up at the building like it was a final boss.
      <br>“Okay,” he muttered, clutching his backpack like a lifeline. “It’s just school. In a new country. With strangers. And maybe cat people. No big deal.”
      <br>He took one step inside and immediately got bumped by someone with fox ears and a full-on tail, sprinting down the hall with toast in their mouth.
      <br>Ren blinked. “…I guess that is normal here.”
      <br>Still reeling from that, he walked toward his classroom, checking the tiny paper in his hand for the room number. The halls were packed, buzzing with chatter, tails swishing, ears twitching, and a lot more fangy smiles than he was used to back home.
      <br>Then he saw her.
      <br>She was standing at her locker, fixing her hair—a soft, shiny black bob—and flicking her fluffy cat ears back into place. ||
